# Material Design Icons For Rails

Ruby on Rails view helpers for Material Design. Based largely on the
[beehiiv gem for Heroicon](https://github.com/bharget/heroicon).

This gem covers the official Google Material Icon set available at
https://github.com/google/material-design-icons and
https://fonts.google.com/icons?selected=Material+Icons. It does not
yet cover the Material Symbol set of icons.

## License

The gem is available as open source under the terms of the
[Apache 2.0 license](https://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0) license,
which is what the Material Design project uses.
